Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your local government area. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. You'll be given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.




#most of the coding for this exercise was written in VSCode and loaded into Jupyter Notebook
# pandas-challenge

# Some difficulty arise around the pd.cut exercise of this homework
# Googled for solution and came across GitHub

# Issue when tyring to do binning and pd.cut due to Error converting to numerical values
# have to return to earlier solutions to convert the data to floats and integers 

# This helped to remove the error and eventually allow me to continue with the challenge
